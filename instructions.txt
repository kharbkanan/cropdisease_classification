PLANT DISEASE CLASSIFICATION PROJECT - INSTRUCTIONS
====================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
This project is a deep learning-based system for classifying plant diseases from leaf images.
It supports multiple crops (Corn, Potato, Rice, Sugarcane, Wheat) and provides an interactive
web interface using Streamlit.

SUPPORTED CROPS AND DISEASES
----------------------------
- Corn: Common Rust, Gray Leaf Spot, Northern Leaf Blight, Healthy
- Potato: Early Blight, Late Blight, Healthy
- Rice: Brown Spot, Leaf Blast, Neck Blast, Healthy
- Sugarcane: Bacterial Blight, Red Rot, Healthy
- Wheat: Brown Rust, Yellow Rust, Healthy

INSTALLATION
------------
1. Install Python 3.8 or higher
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

SETUP AND TRAINING
------------------
1. Reorganize Dataset (if needed):
   python reorganize_for_disease_training.py
   
   This creates a flat structure: data/train_diseases/{crop}_{disease}/

2. Train the Model:
   python train_disease_model.py
   
   This will:
   - Load images from data/train_diseases/ (or data/train/ as fallback)
   - Train a MobileNetV2-based model
   - Save the model to models/disease_classifier.keras
   - Save label mappings to models/ directory

   Training Time: 30 minutes to several hours (depending on hardware)

3. Verify Model:
   python test_prediction.py

RUNNING THE WEB APP
-------------------
Launch the Streamlit web application:
   streamlit run app.py

The app will open in your default web browser at http://localhost:8501

USING THE WEB APP
-----------------
1. Upload Image: Click "Browse files" and select a plant leaf image
2. Predict: Click the "Predict Disease" button
3. View Results: See the predicted crop, disease name, confidence score, and recommended remedy
4. Explore: View alternative predictions in the expandable sections

CONFIGURATION
-------------
Model Parameters (train_disease_model.py):
- IMG_SIZE: Image input size (default: 224x224)
- BATCH_SIZE: Training batch size (default: 32)
- EPOCHS: Number of training epochs (default: 10)

Prediction Parameters (predict_disease.py):
- top_k: Number of top predictions to return (default: 3)

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Model Not Found Error:
- Ensure you've run the training script first
- Check that models/disease_classifier.keras exists
- Verify the model directory path in predict_disease.py

Incorrect Predictions:
- Ensure the model was trained on the reorganized dataset
- Check that the label mappings match your dataset structure
- Verify that images are preprocessed correctly (224x224, RGB)

MODEL PERFORMANCE
-----------------
- Architecture: MobileNetV2 (transfer learning)
- Input Size: 224x224 RGB images
- Classes: 17 disease classes
- Augmentation: Rotation, shifts, zoom, flipping, brightness adjustment

NOTES
-----
- Model files are saved in the models/ directory (ignored by git)
- Training data should be in data/train_diseases/ or data/train/
- The web app requires the trained model to be present in models/
- Images should be clear, well-lit, and focused on the leaf area
